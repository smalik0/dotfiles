# dotfiles
My personal dotfile repo

This repo contains the main dotfiles necessary for my coding environment. There is additional setup necessary, but this has the bulk of the config.

install by running the following:
cd
git clone git://github.com/smalik0/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
chmod +x ./install
./install
